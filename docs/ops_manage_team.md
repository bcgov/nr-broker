# Manage my teams

You can view teams in the Broker by navigating to the browse page (/browse) and selecting the team collection from the dropdown menu. To see only the teams of which you are a member, select show "connected." For convenience, a direct link is available in the sections tab on the home page.

If you are assigned the owner role, membership management has been delegated to you. Owners can edit team membership by clicking the "Members" button in the top-right corner.

## How to add/remove users

* Access NR Broker
* Navigate to the browser and view the 'Team' collection
* Find the team to modify and navigate to it by clicking on the row
* Click the "Members" button
* Modify role membership

**To add:** Select the desired role from the dropdown menu. Type until the desired user appears, then select them and click "Add."

> User not showing? Users are imported the first time they login to NR Broker. The easiest way to add users is to send them the link and have them login.

**To remove:** Click the user to select them and then click remove for the role

## What do the roles mean?

The roles are defined on the Team tab in the browser section. The roles may be used by external products that read NR Broker's database to grant permissions. For further information, please read your own documention that should be linked from your Broker deployment's homepage.

## How to reassign ownership

To assign a new person as the owner of the team, add the new person as an owner of the team. If required, this person can then remove you as an owner of the team.
