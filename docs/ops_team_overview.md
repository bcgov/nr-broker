# What is a team in Broker?

A team in Broker represents a group of people working together on projects and services. Teams are the main way Broker organizes access.

## Team basics

When you're part of a team, you automatically get the permissions you need to work with your team's resources. You don't need to request individual permissions for each project or service. The access you receive often depends on your role.

## Not a member of a team?

Any user can view every team and its membership. If you wish to request access, please reach out to a team owner or use the team's contact details.

## Working with other teams

Teams can connect their work together. For instance:
- One team might provide a service that other teams use
- Teams can see how their services depend on each other

These connections show up in Broker's graph view, making it easy to understand how different parts of your system work together.

## Team structure

Each team typically includes:
- **Team members** - People who can work with the team's resources
- **Projects** - High-level groupings of related work
- **Services** - Individual applications or components your team maintains
- **Repositories** - Source control repositories that your team maintains

The browse and graph section allow you to filter the view based on what you are connected to through your teams.

## Team ownership

Team owners control what roles people have. If you're a team owner, you can:
- Add new people to your team
- Remove people from your team
- Add a new role to someone on your team (for example, promote someone to owner)
- Manage team settings

Every team needs at least one owner to manage access. If you need to become an owner or add another owner to your team, contact your current team owner or your organization's Broker administrator.
